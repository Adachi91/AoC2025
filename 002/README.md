# How was your day?
I woke up 5 minutes until a doctor appointment and made it 2 minutes past my check in time, lucky there was little traffic, probably because it snowed.

The snow was pretty, it lasted for a while because it was cloudy longer than expected, but then it got sunny and the snow went away.

Anyways adachi signing off.
