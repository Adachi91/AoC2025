# Advent of Code 2025-12-05 Challenge
[x] Completed Silver

# How was your day?
This one was a bit tougher than I thought it to be originally. I thought it would be very simple, until I consumed all of my `commit` when running the first iteration of code.  
Though, it worked out in the end and I'm kind of happy I switched to making a Blocks class and seeing them as blocks with min and max ranges.  

Anyways adachi signing off.
